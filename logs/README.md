# Directory: logs/

## Overview

The `logs/` directory is reserved for storing runtime outputs, debug logs, and auditing traces generated by various parts of the infrastructure lifecycle.

These logs are generated by both local scripts (e.g., shell/Python helpers) and GitHub Actions runs. This separation ensures that engineers can inspect outputs post-deployment, troubleshoot runtime behavior, or archive logs for auditability.

## Contents

| File/Pattern | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `*.log` | Execution logs from scripts and CLI tools |
| `terraform-*.log` | Captured logs during Terraform operations (plan/apply/test) |
| `introspection-*.json` | JSON-structured logs from service audits or config inspections |

## Logging Strategy

- All logs are written in plain text or JSON to simplify downstream ingestion.
- GitHub Actions jobs use the built-in `tee` command to capture output to `logs/`.
- Python utilities implement structured logging where applicable.

## Usage

Scripts and workflows automatically write logs into this folder. For example:

```shell
scripts/manage/profile-activity.shell > logs/iam-inspection.log
```

You can also audit infrastructure state like this:

```shell
terraform show -json > logs/infra-state.json
```

## DevSecOps Consideration

- This folder plays a crucial role in incident response and traceability.
- Zero-trust policy recommends rotating or exporting logs off-host post-deploy.
- Logs may contain sensitive metadataâ€”ensure proper access controls are enforced.

## Future Plans

- [ ] Automate log upload to secure GCS/S3 bucket post-deploy
- [ ] Implement log rotation and archiving policy
- [ ] Integrate with external log aggregation platforms (e.g., ELK, Cloud Logging)
- [ ] Add sensitive-data scrubbing mechanism before publishing logs
