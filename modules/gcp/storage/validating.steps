### 1. **Test the IAM Bindings via Terraform Console**:
   Since you're using `google_storage_bucket_iam_binding` and groups for IAM bindings, you can start by validating the IAM bindings via `terraform console`. Here's what you can do:

   - **Start a Terraform Console**:
     ```bash
     terraform console
     ```

   - **Verify the group credentials**:
     Inside the console, you can query the `local.group_credentials` to check if the groupings are correct:
     ```hcl
     local.group_credentials
     ```

   This will return the structure of how the `group_credentials` map is populated, allowing you to verify if the credentials are correctly assigned to groups.

   - **Verify IAM Bindings**:
     You can also verify the IAM bindings by querying the `google_storage_bucket_iam_binding` resources:
     ```hcl
     google_storage_bucket_iam_binding.bucket_bindings
     ```
     This should return the IAM bindings as expected, with each role bound to the correct service account groups.

   - **Check for Group Assignments**:
     Specifically for each role, check if the members are grouped correctly. You could test it by verifying the assigned IAM roles:
     ```hcl
     google_storage_bucket_iam_binding.bucket_bindings["roles/storage.objectAdmin"].members
     ```
     This will allow you to see which service accounts (grouped as per your configuration) are assigned to this role.

### 2. **Test Access Control with Service Accounts**:
   Another way to test the groupings is to simulate access to the GCP resources based on the service accounts you assigned. For example:

   - **Test Permissions**: Use `gcloud` to verify that the service accounts have the correct permissions based on their assigned roles. You can use `gcloud iam` commands to simulate actions as the service account, and check whether they have access to specific GCP resources.

   Example:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=/path/to/service/account/key.json
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy your-project-id --flatten="bindings[].members" --filter="bindings.members:serviceAccount:your-service-account@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
   ```
   This should show you the roles assigned to that specific service account, confirming that it's correctly mapped to a group.

### 3. **Use `terraform show` to Inspect the State**:
   You can inspect the Terraform state to see if the changes have been correctly applied and to verify that the resources are correctly associated:
   ```bash
   terraform show
   ```
   This will output the entire state, including IAM bindings, groups, and roles. Check that the `google_storage_bucket_iam_binding` resource reflects your intended group assignments.

### 4. **Unit Test (Optional)**:
   If you want to automate this testing and ensure that the group-based logic works over time, consider writing unit tests for the Terraform code using `terraform-compliance` or a similar framework. This would allow you to write tests for your infrastructure as code to ensure things stay as intended as the code evolves.

### 5. **Manual Validation**:
   If you prefer to validate manually:
   - Go to the IAM section of the GCP console.
   - Check the IAM roles assigned to the service accounts created for each group.
   - Ensure the permissions are correct for each group.

### Key Points to Validate:
- **Group-based access**: Verify that all credentials are correctly mapped to their respective groups.
- **IAM roles**: Ensure the correct roles are assigned to the right service accounts based on their group.
- **Permissions**: Test if users (via their GitHub actions) have the correct access depending on the environment.
